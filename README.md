# AI Powered Smart Email Classifier for Enterprises

 Project Overview
Enterprises receive thousands of emails daily such as customer complaints, service requests, feedback, and spam. Manually sorting these emails is time-consuming and inefficient.  
This project focuses on building an AI-powered email classification system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically categorize emails and assign urgency levels.
